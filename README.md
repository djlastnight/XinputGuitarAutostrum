# Xinput Guitar Autostrum
Modified xinput*.dll, intended to send guitar strum along with the xinput guitar fret button.  
Note that using this dll file is considered cheating.  
Use at own risk.

# Requirements
Installed vcredist 2013 x86

# DLL File naming
The default dll file name is xinput1_3.dll

If it does not work for your game, you can use one of the following names:
* xinput1_1.dll
* xinput1_2.dll
* xinput9_1_0.dll
That depends on the game.

# How to use
To enable the guitar autostrum hack,
you have to copy the modified xinput*.dll
to the desired game's folder (next to game's exe file).  
When you start the game, at given moment it will search for xinput*.dll file.  
When the hacked xinput*.dll file is loaded you will hear a beep sound.

The hack will only works for xinput controller #1 (this is hardcoded),  
which obviously must be a [guitar | guitar_alt | guitar_bass] xinput subtype.

# How to temporary disable
To ensure normal menu navigating, the hack will stop sending strum when you push the whammy bar (50% or more).

# How to uninstall
To play the game normally, just delete the xinput1_3.dll from its folder.

# Download
You can download the xinput1_3.dll directly from the Build folder or from this link
