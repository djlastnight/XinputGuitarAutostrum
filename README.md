# Xinput Guitar Autostrum
Modified xinput*.dll, intended to send guitar strum along with the guitar fret button

# Requirements
Installed vcredist 2013 x86

# How to use
To enable the guitar autostrum hack,
you have to copy the modified xinput1_3.dll
to the desired game's folder (next to game's exe file).
When you start the game, after a given moment you should hear a beep sound.
This indicates that the game has been loaded the modified xinput file successfully.

The mod will only works for xinput controller #1 (this is hardcoded),
which obviously must be a [guitar | guitar_alt | guitar_bass] xinput subtype.

# How to disable
To ensure normal menu navigations, the mod will not work, when you held the whammy bar (50% or more).

# How to uninstall
To play the game normally, just delete the xinput1_3.dll from its folder.

# Download
You can download the xinput1_3.dll from Build folder
