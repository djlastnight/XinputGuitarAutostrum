# Xinput Guitar Autostrum
Modified xinput*.dll, intended to send guitar strum along with the guitar fret button

# Requirements
Installed vcredist 2013 x86

To enable the guitar autostrum hack,
you have to copy the modified xinput1_3.dll
to the desired game's folder (next to game's exe file).
When you start the game, after a given moment you should hear a beep sound.
This indicates that the game has been loaded the modified dll file successfully.

The mod will only works for xinput controller #1,
which obviously must be a [guitar | guitar_alt | guitar_bass] xinput subtype.

To ensure normal menu navigations, the mod will not work, when you held the whammy bar (50% or more).

To play the game normally (not modded), just delete the xinput1_3.dll from its folder.
