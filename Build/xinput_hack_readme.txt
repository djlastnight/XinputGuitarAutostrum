xinput1_3.dll (hacked)

To enable the guitar autostrum hack,
you have to copy the included xinput1_3.dll
to the desired game's folder (next to game's exe file).
When you start the game, after a given moment you should hear a beep sound.
This means it loaded the hacked dll file.

The hack will only works for xinput controller #1,
which obviously must be a guitar, guitar_alt or guitar_bass xinput subtype.

To ensure normal menu navigations, the hack won't work,
when you held the whammy bar (50% or more).

To play the game normally, just delete the xinput1_3.dll from its folder.

Have fun,
